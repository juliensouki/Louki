# Contributing to Louki

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Even though I do not work on Louki anymore, all types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See my [contribution suggestions](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/wiki/Contribution-suggestions) if you don't know what to work on.

## I Have a Question

> Feel free to ask a question, but I encourage you to read the [documentation](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/wiki) first.

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

I will then get back to you as soon as I can.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/wiki).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug (see the bug report template)
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed, I will get back to you as soon as I can.
