# Louki

## What is Louki ?
> The project just started. It will be finished in March/April 2020.

Louki will be a web application, providing basic music management features : 
- [ ] Get songs (and meta data) in folder chosen by user 
- [ ] Create/Manage/Delete playlists
- [ ] Music player (pause, repeat, next/prev song...)
- [ ] Search by artist/album
- [ ] Search song in playlist
- [ ] Custom settings 
- [ ] Web scrapping to update songs information

Louki will be an open-source and cross-platform solution. The main objective is to create a reusable solution, easily improvable so that any developer can use it and make it how they want.

## Cross-platform

Louki is developed as a web application in order to be able to be ran on Windows/MacOS/Linux, since it only needs a browser. It will be ran locally since there is no point to deploy it.
