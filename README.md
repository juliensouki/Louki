## What is Louki ?
Louki is an open-source music player I wrote when I was a student. My goal was to provide a basic tool that supports the core features of a music player/manager so that it can be reused by other people to create more advanced projects.

You will find the documentation [here](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/wiki).

## Features

Here are the main features:
- [x] Play/pause music
- [x] Activate random order mode
- [x] Activate playlist or music loop mode
- [x] Go to the next or previous music
- [x] Create a profile and customize a bunch of settings
- [x] Load/unload music files using a folder path
- [x] Create/update/delete playlist
- [x] Add to remove music from favorites
- [x] Display all of your music
- [x] Display music by artist/album
- [x] Change volume
- [x] Search for a music in a playlist
- [x] Use the app in English or French
