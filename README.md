## What is Louki ?
Louki is an open-source music player I wrote when I was a student. My goal was to provide a basic tool that supports the core features of a music player/manager so that it can be reused by other people to create more advanced projects.

You will find the documentation [here](https://github.com/juliensouki/Louki/wiki).

## Features

Here are the main features:
- Display all of your music
- Display music by artist/album
- Create/update/delete playlist
- Search for a music in a playlist
- Add and remove music favorites
- Play/pause music
- Go to the next or previous music
- Activate random order mode
- Activate playlist or music loop mode
- Change volume
- Create a profile and customize a bunch of settings
- Load/unload music files using a folder path
- Use the app in English or French
